1. indexOf and includes check if simple types, by value,if complex types, by references
2. typeof sucks, use Object.prototype.toString.call(something)
3. Always beware and check arguments when using built-in function. Passing built-in function blindly will be fatal and hard to debug
4. The magic of {}+{}, []+[], {}+[], []+{}
5. 10.toString() ---> error, 10..toString() ---> '10', 0x10.toString ---> 16, 0x10..toString() ---> error
6. Anything can be thrown, only seen as 'uncaught `something`', and anything can be caught
7. null==undefined => true but null===undefined => false, so always use '==='
8. check null with '===' only evaluates true if is is set to null explicitly.
9. parseFloat and parseInt blindly converts argument
10. Object as hashmap, sometimes annoying, most of the time useful
11. parseInt does not force correctness, instead it tries to parse what it is and not throwing error
Extra;(not js specific) dynamic languages suffer from precision (try 0.1+0.2 or 0.1+0.7)
